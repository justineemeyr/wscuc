# Accreditation Leadership Academy


## Course Description

The WASC Senior College & University Commission Accreditation Leadership Academy is (WSCUC) is a professional development program for higher education leaders. Through the application of both theoretical and practical frameworks for thought and action, the ALA considers the intersections and implications of:
 
- The assurance of equity and the importance of inclusion and diversity in higher education culture and practice
- The need for effective leadership, systems, and evidence to achieve quality
 
And addresses these themes through a focus on **Equity, Evidence, and Effectiveness** in service of:
 
- Enhancing individual professional practice
- Addressing an institutional need
- Developing skilled leadership for higher education
 
The curriculum explores critical issues to produce actionable approaches to a pressing need identified by each participant and their institution, and participants learn through collaboration with Academy faculty and mentors and work with peers in small and large groups. Faculty and mentors are leaders in higher education practice drawn from the WSCUC community and from the broader community of international scholars and professionals, WSCUC Fellows, Assessment Leadership Academy alumni, and Community of Practice (CoP) participants.
